# DesignPatterns


# Structural Patterns
	- Adapter Pattern: Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
	- Bridge Pattern: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
	- Composite Pattern: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
	- Decorator Pattern: Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
	- Facade Pattern: Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
	- Proxy Pattern: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
