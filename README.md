# DesignPatterns



## Structural Patterns
- **Adapter Pattern:** Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
- **Bridge Pattern:** Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
- **Composite Pattern:** Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
- **Decorator Pattern:** Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
- **Facade Pattern:** Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
- **Proxy Pattern:** Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

## Creational Patterns
- **Singleton Pattern:** Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
- **Factory Method Pattern:** Defines an interface for creating an object, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Abstract Factory Pattern:** Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Builder Pattern:** Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
- **Prototype Pattern:** Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as a prototype, during runtime.
